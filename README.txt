The main method is in the class org.example.main.App

This is the 2nd version of the selling internet packages project.
The first version didn't meet the requirements of the assignment because
I stored saved packages on the disk instead of storing them in working memory by using
ObservableList, so I changed that in this version. I cleaned up the code as well, code in this version
is cleaner than the code in the first version (at least I think so).
Also, I removed the responsibility of the class InternetPackage of saving itself, now controller class
is responsible for it. Maybe I will add in the future the option for permanent storage in this version
of the project as well, since I am more pleased with the design that I did in this project.
If I add the option for permanent storage, I will probably make anotehr class to deal with that, we will see.
